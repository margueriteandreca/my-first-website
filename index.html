                <p class="sections">Hi! My name is Marguerite and I am a Software Engineering 
                    student at Flatiron School in New York City. I was raised in Queens, New York 
                    and to this day it is still my favorite outer borough due to its diversity and 
                    authentic food. <br><br>
                    Like many of us, I love to travel - even more so to meet my <span id="hover-img">international 
                    friends</span>
                    in their home countries. To me, there is nothing better than discovering a new place
                    with a local while creating memories together in a way that is totally unique. I also l
                    ove to cook and share with others (in hopes of praise). I'm an only child, 
                    prefer mountains to the beach, and have an unexplainable love for cows. <br><br>
                    In terms of this course, I am quite new to programming. For a long time, I imagined my 
                    career path to be one in law. However, the more I learn to code, the more I feel this was
                    the right path for me all along.

                My goal in starting a career in software engineering is to build and contribute to
                technologies that make all of our lives a bit better. I want to create beautifully 
                designed, intuitive websites that makes a significant boost in user experience. The 
                process of creating this website has been equally enjoyable as it as been frustrating,
                and so I will use the limitations I faced as motivation to expand my knowledge in those 
                areas. <br><br> 
                Since I know less about the details of back end, and I am excited to 
                become more familiar with its languages and the way in which it integrates with what I am
                already familiar with - front end. In the near future, I hope to build a website so 
                impressive one day that I will look back to this first attempt with fondess, or perhaps a bit of
                embarrassment. <br><br>
                I look forward to learning and growing with you all.
