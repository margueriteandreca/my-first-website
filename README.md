# My Personal Website

My first website is divided into three sections - the introduction, the "About Me" and a last section containing both "My Goals" and "Contact"

In order to create a light mode/dark mode functionality, I created a floating button using two icons, and then used JavaScript to make this button change between two css files - one light mode, and one dark mode.
